--Task 3 

Part 1- Passwordless ssh between tow linux servers

1. Created two new Linux VMs in Azure namely:
	Linux1
	Linux2

2. Configured passwordless ssh from Linux1 to Linux2 - steps below:

	a. Connected (ssh) to Linux1 using putty 
	b. Generated a public/private key pair by executing the following command:

		#ssh-keygen -t rsa

	c. Saved generated key in the default location
	
	d. Connected (ssh) to Linux2 using putty
	e. Copied over the public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on LinuxTwo by executing the following:
		from home directory:

		i.   #vi  .ssh/authorized_keys --to open 'authorized_keys' file in edit mode 
		ii.  copied and pasted the public key 
		iii. save file (wq)
	
	f. Ensured I had read/write permission on .ssh/authorized_keys - executed the following command
		#chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys


3. Test connectivity from Linux1 to Linux2
	#ssh Linux2 --successful

4. Repeated step 2 to setup passwordless ssh from Linux2 to Linux1

5. Test connectivity from Linux2 to Linux1
	#ssh Linux1 --successful

	
Part 2 - Install the MySQL server on Linux1

1. Executed the following command on Linux1:
	#sudo apt-get update
	#sudo apt-get install mysql-server

2. Enabled remote access to Linux1
 
	#sudo ufw allow mysql
	#sudo ufw allow from <Linux1 ip address here> to any port 3306
	#vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf -- to view the bind address
	#Change the bind address to 0.0.0.0
	

3. Restarted mysql service

	#systemctl restart mysql.service

4. Configure MySQL user (utest) to allow access from any host to Linux1
	
	#Connected to mysql using root account viz mysql -u root -p
	#CREATE USER 'utest'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'passwordhere';
	
5. Created wordpress database on Linux1
	#Create database wordpressdb

6. Granted access to all databases on Linux1 to utest
	#GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO utest@'%' 

Part 3 - install mysql client on Linux2

1. Executed the following

	#sudo apt-get install mysql-client

Part 4 - Test connectivity from mysql client on Linux2 to mysql server on Linux1
	#princeg@Linux2:~$ mysql -u utest -h <ipaddress of Linux1> -p 

	#Connectivity successful
