1) Amend my python script called 'app.py' in the following location:

/home/ubuntu/goa/Python-Sample-Application/app.py

2) Create a service file with the .service extention called "uber_app_service.service" in the following location:

/lib/systemd/system

3) Enable newly added service by running the following command

sudo systemctl daemon-reload 

4) Enable the service to start on system boot, also start the service using the following commands:

sudo systemctl enable uber_app_service.service
sudo systemctl start uber_app_service.service

5) Check the status of your service

sudo systemctl status uber_app_service.service
